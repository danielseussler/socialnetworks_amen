# Theory

Let $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a sociomatrix describing a network and $Y_{ij}$ describing the directed relationship between actor $i$ and $j$. The former is considered to be the sender, the latter the receiver of the network tie. Because we assume the actors to be acting within a network environment, there is *a priori* no reason to assume (conditional) independence of the observations $Y_{ij}$. 

First, the set $\{Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}, Y_{ik}\}$ could exhibit higher similarity within itself than with other observations, due to the common sender $i$. I. e., we could see sender (and receiver) specific heterogeneity in the propensity to send (or receive) network ties. These are first-order network effects which are observed on a nodal basis. Involving two nodes, i.e., a dyadic relationship, we could see patterns of reciprocity. This is characterized by the statistical dependency between observation $Y_{ij}$ and $Y_{ji}$, where $i \neq j$. Third, there is reason to assume dependence involving triadic relationships within a given network. These could be transitivity, balance, and clustering, and are best described by proverbs such as *the enemy of my enemy is my friend* and *my friends friend is also my friend*.

For a sociomatrix $Y$$ we define the following network statistics. Note that, since we ruled out self-ties within a network, for any given sociomatrix we assume the diagonal to be undefined. Undefined observations should therefore be dropped in the following calculations.

*First-order effects* characterize the actor specific heterogeneity in sending (or receiving) ties within a network. In a homogenous sender setting, we would expect the row means $\bar{Y_{i \cdot}}$ to be equal (or column means). Heterogeneity in sending or receiving ties is therefore modeled by the standard deviation of the respective row- and columnmeans: 
$$sd.rowmean(Y) = \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{1}{n} \left( \bar{Y_{i \cdot}}-\bar{Y} \right)^2 \text{, and  } sd.colmean(Y) = \sum^{m}_{i = 1} \frac{1}{m} \left( \bar{Y_{\cdot j}}-\bar{Y} \right)^2.$$

*Second-order effects*, i.e., reciprocity, describe the statistical dependency of the directed relationship between two actors in the network. For the relationship between country $i$ and $j$, the correlation to the relationship of actor $j$ to $i$, where $i \neq j$, captures this effect. It is given as 
$$dyadic.dep(Y) = corr(vec(Y), vec(Y^\top).$$
Here, $vec(A)$ is a $m n \times 1$ column vector, which is obtained by stacking the columns of $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ on top of another. Naturally, for an undirected network dyadic dependency is 1. 

*Third-order effects* are patterns among three nodes and corresponding statistics should capture triadic relationships   as described above. Let $E = Y - \bar{Y}$. Then 
$$cycle.dependency(Y) = \frac{1}{n (n-1) (n-2)} \sum_{i \neq j \neq k \neq i} E_{ij} E_{jk} E_{ki},$$
$$trans.dependency(Y) = \frac{1}{n (n-1) (n-2)} \sum_{i \neq j \neq k \neq i} E_{ij} E_{jk} E_{ik}.$$
Optionally the statistics can be standardized with $sd(vec(Y))^3$. Naturally, for an undirected network cycle dependency equals transitive dependency. In the process of model selection, the network statistics above can be used to assess model fit. Based on draws from the posterior distribution (as we later follow a bayesian approach to model estimation), sociomatrices are simulated and respective goodness of fit statistics computed. This yields a distribution of network dependencies which is then compared to the observed statistic.

The Additive and Multiplicative Effects network model is based on two types of random effects, additive and multiplicative, which are added to a generalized linear regression framework. The inclusion guarantees that the error structure takes into account the types of network dependencies inherent in dyadic observations. I introduce both separately and start with the additive component.


**Additive Effects: The Social Relations Regression Model**

To accomodate actor-specific hetereogeneity beyond fixed covariates, sender and receiver additive random effects $(a_i, b_j)$ are included in an extended error component. Let $\mu$ be a mean or a linear predictor $\beta^\top x_{ij}$. This yields the following model: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
      Y_{ij} &= \mu + e_{ij} \\
      e_{ij} &= a_{i} + b_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
      \{ (a_{1}, b_{1}), \ldots, (a_{n}, b_{n}) \} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_{ab}) \\ 
      \{ (\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ji}) : \; i \neq j\} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_{\epsilon}), \text{ where } \\
      \Sigma_{ab} = \begin{pmatrix} 
      \sigma_{a}^{2} & \sigma_{ab} \\ 
      \sigma_{ab} & \sigma_{b}^2   \end{pmatrix}, 
      \quad \: &\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} 
      \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ 
      \rho & 1  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Parameter interpretation is straight forward. Nodal random effects $a_i$, $b_j$ are independent normal gaussian variables with zero mean and covariance matrix $\Sigma_{ab}$ for $i, j = 1, \dots, n$. The covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\epsilon}$ of the error term $\epsilon$ is composed of the variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$ and a reciprocity parameter $\rho$.


**Multiplicative Effects: The Latent Factor Model**

The nodal random effects are able to capture first- and second-order network effects, but cannot account for triadic relationships within the data. This is described in the application case below, but can also be seen as follows. 

Let $r \in \mathbb{N}$ be the dimension of the latent space. Then 
$$\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r}, \quad i,j = 1, \ldots, n$$
adding lsjflasjkd this yields as component of the extended error term. 
$$\alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) = \textbf{u}_{i}^{T} L \textbf{v}_{j} = \sum^{r}_{k = 1}  u_{ik} L_{kk} v_{kj}$$
where $L$ is an $r \times r$ diagonal matrix. Determining the dimension of the latent space is not a trivial task and is to be considered alongside other modeling restrictions. Choosing lower rank dimensions facilitates visualization of the estimated effects. 


**The AME Model: Additive + Multiplicative Effects**

Merging both types of random effects yields the Additive and Multiplicative network effects model, which is able to account for the network effects described above. The model is specified as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
      y_{ij} &= \beta^{T} \mathbf{x}_{ij} + e_{ij} \\
      e_{ij} &= a_{i} + b_{j}  + \alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) + \epsilon_{ij} \text{, where}     
\end{aligned}
$$
and $a_i$, $b_j$, $\alpha(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j})$ with the respective covariance structure as defined above. It is estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach described in the following section. 


**Parameter Estimation**

The model is estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, summarized for the AME *without* multiplicative effects in Algorithm 1. This is in turn extended to include the multiplicative effects in Algorithm 2. Let 
$$
\begin{aligned}  
  \beta &\sim \mathcal{N}_p(\beta_0, Q^{-1}_0),\\
  \frac{1}{\sigma^2} &\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{\nu_0}{2}, \frac{\nu_0 \sigma^2}{2} \right),\\
  \Sigma^{-1} &\sim \text{Wishart} \left( \frac{\Sigma^{-1}_0}{\eta_0}, \eta_0 \right)
\end{aligned} 
$$
be our prior distributions. 
```{=latex}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
Initalize unkown variables\;
1. Simulate $\{ \beta, a, b \}$ given $Y, \Sigma, \sigma^2, \rho$\;
2. Simulate $\sigma^2$ given $Y, \beta, a, b, \rho$\;
3. Simulate $\rho$ given $Y, \beta, a, b, \sigma^2$\; 
4. Simulate $\Sigma$ given $a, b$\; 
5. Simulate missing values of $Y$ given $\beta, a, b, \rho, \sigma^2$ and observed values of $Y$.
 \caption{Gibbs Sampling for the SRRM, P. D. Hoff (2021).}
\end{algorithm}
```
To apply the Gibbs sampling, we derive the full conditionals for the unknown variables. 
$$p(E \vert \sigma^2, \rho) \propto (\sigma^2)^{\frac{-n^2}{2}} (1-\rho^2)^{-\frac{1}{2} \binom{N}{k}} (1-\rho^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \exp^{-\frac{(SS_1 + SS_2)}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where $SS_1 = \sum_{i<j}$ and $SS_2 = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{e^2_{ii}} {1+ \rho}$.

Full conditional 

$$\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sim \text{Gamma}\left( \frac{1}{2}(\nu_0 + n^2), \frac{1}{2} (\nu_0 \sigma^2_0 + SS_1 + SS_2) \right)$$

And lastly 
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\beta \vert y, \Sigma) &\propto p(y \vert \beta, \Sigma) \cdot p(\beta) \\
&\propto \exp\{-\frac{1}{2} \beta^\top (Q_0 + Q) \beta + \beta^\top(Q_0\beta_0 + l)\} \\
&\propto \mathcal{N}_p( (Q_0 + Q)^{-1}(Q_0\beta_0 + l), (Q_0 + Q)^{-1})
\end{aligned}
$$


Adding multiplicative effects is accomplished as follows:

```{=latex}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
Initalize unkown variables\;
1. Update $\{ \beta, a, b, \sigma^2, \rho, \Sigma \}$ and the missing values of $Y$ using Algorithm 1, but with $Y$ replaced by $Y$ - $UV^T$\;
2. Simulate $\Psi^{-1} \sim$ Wishart $((\Psi_0 \kappa_0 + [UV]^\top [UV])^{-1}, \kappa_0 + n)$, where $[UV]$ is the $n \times 2r$ matrix equal to the column-wise concatenation of $U$ and $V$\;
3. For each $k = 1, \dots, r$, simulate the $r$-th columns of $U$ and $V$ from their full conditional distributions. 
 \caption{Gibbs Sampling for the AME, P. D. Hoff (2021).}
\end{algorithm} 
```

**Extensions**

Note that by now we have assumed a normal distribtution of the outcome variable. However, the presented framework can be extended in several different ways. For one thing, additional types of outcome variables can be specified, such as binary, count, ordinal, and censored data. Ordinal data includes ranked categorical outcomes, such as *reject, neutral, agree*.  This requires changes to the sampling algorithms as described above. For the specific changes to the algorithms and full conditionals, as for example required in the binary case for the following application case, see @Hoff2021. Estimation of missing data points could be an objective. In the bayesian estimation approach, imputation of missing data is easily available through posterior simulation. A third possibility is an extension to include longitudinal or replicated networks, where a (possibly changing) set of actors is observed at different time points. The R-package `amen` provides the option to include replicated data, where time is modeled by including lagged covariates. A different approach is presented in @dynamicAMEN, where the AME network model is embedded in a Gaussian process.

# Application Case: Interstate Defence Alliances
To illustrate the purpose of network analysis approaches we turn our attention to the field of international relations. More specifically, I apply the beforehand introduced AME network model to the interstate defense alliances network in the year 2000. Alliance formation in an interstate framework provides an interesting application case, both because of the availability of data and the assumed extent of network effects inherent in the strategic decisions of state actors. Neglecting the latter effects by presuming conditional independence of observations, as in the classical regression framework, could seriously bias parameter estimates (@statIssue).

The data is an excerpt from the data used in @ComplexDependencies and @TowardNetwork and contains the yearly defense network as a time series from 1981 to 2000.^[The data set `alliances` can be conveniently accessed as network data in the R-Package `xergm.common`.] It furthermore includes information on military capabilities, political regime types, geographic borders and interstate conflict. From here on out, I refer to this data set as the alliances data set. 

The analysis is structured as follows. First, restricted to a cross-sectional study of the year 2000, I examine the alliances structure with respect to the network statistics and preliminary models. Second, to motivate the statistical network approach, I estimate four different specifications and compare these with respect to their goodness of fit. I conclude with a discussion of challenges and improvements of the AME network model.The computational analysis was implemented with the R-Software (@rsoftware) and the AMEN R-Package (@ramen).

```


**Network Statistics**

The alliances data set includes 158^[This data set covers the period of 1981 - 2000, it includes all countries which were selected at any time of given series. I exclude the Yemen Arab Republic, Yemen People's Republic, German Democratic Republic, German Federal Republic, Yugoslawia, and Czechoslovakia as former countries, which yields a total of 158 countries.] countries and a total of 767 observed interstate alliances. In the respective sociomatrix, a value of 1 indicates the presence of an alliance between two countries, 0 its absence. Note that we have a symmetric matrix, as an alliance between two states is taken to be not directed. 55 countries have no alliance recorded in the data set, the United States and Canada declare the most, with 43 and 39 alliances respectively. The median number of alliances is 9 and the network density is 0.061.

A visualization of the interstate alliance network is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:alliancesfigure). Strong clustering on based geographic proximity is immediately apparent. Located in the upper right of the figure we find the Middle East, below France in the center are the European states. In the left we find the former USSR countries, in the lower part Latin America and the Caribbean states. Perhaps more surprisingly there are two distinct clusters of African states.

Observed statistics of network dependence will be used later on to assess model fit and are computed as described above. First order statistics, the standard deviation of the row- and columnmeans is 0.0596. As our sociomatrix is symmetric, second order dependency is 1. Third order statistics are 0.3881, both for the cycle and transitive dependency, because of symmetry.



**Model Comparison: Interstate Defence Alliances**

I follow the specification of @dynamicAMEN and @geometryofsecurity to define nodal and dyadic covariates which are both sensible to the approach and relevant to the theoretic discussion of interstate alliance networks.^[@dynamicAMEN present a dynamic extension of the AME network model. In @geometryofsecurity the author proceeds with a *stochastic actor-oriented* approach for the analysis of longitudinal network data. The covariates of interest reflect the research field, yet are not directly comparable.] 

*1. Nodal Covariates.* As covariate of interest specific to each actor in the network, I include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in per capita terms and on log scale for each country using data from @wdigdppc. Missing data points are imputed on individual basis.^[Adding the *Composite Index of National Capability* (CINC) as a measure for military capability, appended in the alliances data set, did not improve model fit during preliminary modeling. It is therefore omitted from the analysis.]

*2. Dyadic Covariates.* As dyadic effects I include covariates on geographic factors, political and military similarity, past conflicts, economic dependence, and cultural similarity. The covariates are defined as follows: 

1. $GeoDistance_{ij}$ is the logarithmic geographic distance between two countries measured by the distance of the respective capitals. If the two countries share a border, the log distance is set 0. 
2. $CulturalSim_{ij}$ is a dichotomous variable which takes the value 1, if the most spoken language of two countries is the same, 0 else.^[I use data from the replication files of @geometryofsecurity and choose the year 1985, since the year 2000 did not seem to be accurate. @culturalsimdata is provided as the original data source.] 
3. $EconomicDep_{ij}$ is a measure for the economic dependence of two states, calculated by the share of Imports and Exports to the respective GDP: 
  $$EconomicDep_{ij} = min\left(\frac{Trade_{ij}}{GDP_i}, \frac{Trade_{ij}}{GDP_j} \right) \cdot 100\%$$
  To construct this index, I take data from the Correlates of War Project on trade flows (@tradedata) and @wdigdp. Missing data points for GDP are imputed on individual basis, negative values for trade are set 0. 
4. $SharedAllies_{ij}$ is the number of shared allies between country $i$ and $j$. 
5. $ConflictInd_{ij}$ is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if a militarized interstate dispute was recorded in the preceding 10 years between country $i$ and $j$, 0 else.
6. $PoliticalSim_{ij}$ is constructed using data from the Polity IV Index: 
  $$PoliticalSim_{ij} = \lvert POLITY_i - POLITY_j \rvert$$
  The Polity IV index classifies countries on a 21 point scale from -10 to 10, where -10 to -6 corresponds to autocracies, -5 to 5 to anocracies, and 6 to 10 to democracies. Note that a high value in PoliticalSim corresponds to a high *dissimilarity*.
7. $CapabilityRat_{ij}$ The capability ratio is defined as the log of the relative *Composite Index of National Capability* of both countries, with the stronger state (indicated by the subscript *s*) as the numerator: 
  $$CapabilityRat_{ij} = \log\left(\frac{CINC_s}{CINC_w}\right).$$
At the provided precision, three countries are indistinguishable from 0. I impute these data points with 0.5 times of the second to lowest value.

Note that each dyadic fixed effect is symmetric. To validate the network approach taken in this application case, I estimate four models with different restrictions. One with additive and multiplicative effects (AME), one with only additive effects (AE), one with only multiplicative effects (ME), and one without any types of random effects (NO). The latter one yields a classical (bayesian) probit regression, which does not take into account any type of network effects. This serves as benchmark for our validation. Based on preliminary modeling, I choose rank two for the multiplicative effects.^[A two dimensional latent space facilitates the visualization in the analysis. Moreover, choosing a higher dimension of R = 5 for the latent space did not improve model fit (not shown here, see code appendix for further comparisons).] The results presented in this section are based on 100,000 Gibbs iterations and a burn-in of 10,000. Output density is set at 100. This long sampling and stark thinning is due to symmetric matrices of the multiplicative part, which results in considerably slow mixing of the MCMC chains [see @hoff2015dyadic, p. 44] and high autocorrelation of the estimates.

As elaborated in the subsection on Estimation and Goodness of Fit, model assessment is performed using the goodness of fit statistics of the posterior predictive draws. Figure \@ref(fig:gofstats) illustrates this comparison for our models. The red line indicates the observed goodness of fit statistic for the sociomatrix. On the left, we have a comparison of first-order network statistics, on the right, third-order. As our matrix is symmetric, second-order dependence, i.e. reciprocity, is obsolete and thus omitted.

The first row compares the ordinary (bayesian) probit regression (NO) with the additive effects (AE) model. Predictably, the former (pink) does barely represent the network dependencies present in the data. Adding additive effects does improve this representation (blue). An overestimated first order effect does probably account for the high third order network effect. Still, both models are not able to capture the extent of statistical dependency. In the second row, the additive effects (AE) model is compared to the multiplicative effects model (ME, R = 2, green), which does improve model fit considerably. First order effects are captured very well, representation of third order effects has improved. Comparing multiplicative effects with the full AME Model (grey, third row), both R = 2, show the best fit with respect to the goodness of fit statistics.

Table \@ref(tab:modelcomparison1) and \@ref(tab:modelcomparison2) provide parameter estimates for the four specifications discussed above. Estimates are provided as posterior means, along with the posterior standard deviation and a $p$ - value.^[The $p$ - value is calculated under the assumption of an approximately normal posterior distribution, i.e., $z = \frac{pmean}{psd} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Yet, the $p$ - value should be interpreted with caution, as the density plots do not always suggest approximate normality.] Different specifications lead to vastly different estimates, not only in magnitude but also in changes of the sign. 

We restrict our attention to the AME network model as, based on the network dependencies in figure \@ref(fig:gofstats), it exhibits the best fit in the above comparison. In the AME framework, we can interpret the fixed effects similar to the generalized linear regression framework, with the addition that we condition the effect estimate on the additive and multiplicative random effects. All estimates are directionally consistent with our expectations. A low intercept reflects the low density (0.061) of the interstate alliance network. A higher GDP (log p. c.) is associated *ceteris paribus* and conditional on the random effects with a higher propensity of interstate alliance formation. Geographic distance has a negative effect. Cultural similarity as reflected by joint language, a higher economic dependence, number of shared allies, and previous conflict are all associated with the presence of alliances. In political similarity, a higher dissimilarity is associated with a negative effect on alliance formation, whereas differences in military capability show no effect.

In the AME network model framework, statistical network dependencies will be encoded in the additive and multiplicative, i.e., the random-effects component of the model. We expect the multiplicative component to capture third-order network effects and cluster types of states which share similar characteristics with respect to their tie formation in the network, while additive effects should capture the actor-specific propensity of tie formation. Figure \@ref(fig:LatentSpaceAME) visualizes the latent space obtained with the AME (R=2) model. The multiplicative effect (matrix notation) in a symmetric model is $U^T L U$, where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{158 \times 2}$ and $L \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$. Both $U$ and $L$ are provided as posterior means in the package output, and to visualize the latent space the decomposition of this matrix is computed: $u_{i} = U_{i \cdot } \sqrt{L}$ for $i = 1, \dots, 158$. 

Apart from the scatter in the center of the plot, the multiplicative component captures some interesting geographical factors, which were already apparent in Figure \@ref(fig:alliancesfigure), and are not captured within the $GeoDistance_{ij}$ fixed effect. This includes the Americas on the left and at least two distinct clusters of African states. Russia and some of the former USSR states are clustered in the lower left, the right side has the Middle East and North African countries. 

Additive effects are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:AdditiveEffects). Among the five countries with the highest posterior mean additive effects are Canada, the United States, and France. Switzerland, Sweden, and Austria list among the five countries with the lowest values. This is as expected, as additive effects are added to capture first-order effects, i.e., the propensity to form a network tie.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:traceplotAMEr2) shows the trace plots for the nine fixed effects and the variance of the additive effect in this estimation. Both multimodality and persistent trending are apparent, even *after* strong thinning of 1 to 100. Specifically for the variance of the additive effect and the intercept, which suggests issues with the mixing of the MCMC chains. This is also indicated by the low effective sample size (Table \@ref(tab:modelcomparison1)) for the specifications including multiplicative effects.

To adapt the model, I estimated the following changed specifications of the AME rank 2 model. First, I dropped the Intercept, which yielded worse effective sample sizes. Predictably, the variance of the additive effect increased, along with a change of sign in the fixed effects estimates of *GDP (log p.c.), ConflictInd*, and *CapabilityRat*. Overall it did not seem to improve the estimation.^[This and the following model can be found in the online code appendix and are not shown here.]

Next, I dropped the two covariates with the lowest effective sample size, *SharedAllies* and *ConflictInd*. Except for the intercept, which increased by a third, the estimated variance of the additive effect and the fixed effect estimates remained virtually the same. The issues with the trace plots and the low effective sample size remained. 

Then, I removed all non-significant fixed covariates, leaving only the *Intercept, GeoDistance, EconomicDep, SharedAllies*, and *PoliticalSim*. Again, these changes did not seem to substantially improve the model, the results are shown in Table \@ref(tab:modelcomparison3). This posits the general question of the inclusion of fixed covariates in the model. Estimating an AME rank 2 network model without *any* fixed effects did *not* depress substantially the representation of network dependencies in the estimated model. In practice, this makes covariate selection troublesome.

Lastly, longer burn-in and sampling durations could potentially improve the estimates. However, drastically raising these numbers would push computational feasibility. To verify robustness with respect to the length of the MCMC estimation, I raise the number of iterations to 400,000 after a burn-in period of 100,000.^[The models of the first comparison took about two hours to estimate. Quadrupling the number of iterations in the last model required about ten hours to compute.] Output density is kept the same. Posterior estimates for this model are in Table \@ref(tab:modelcomparison3). The intercept estimate is lower, and the estimate for *ConflictInd* is now negative, although still non-significant. The other fixed-effects estimates are qualitative as before. Moreover, the effective sample size has *not* improved. In the random effects, we see drastically increased variance of the additive effect and the corresponding standard error. This is also apparent upon further inspection of the trace plots in Figure \@ref(fig:ame4xtrace). Figure \@ref(fig:gofstats100vs400) shows a comparison of the posterior goodness of fit statistics for both AME rank 2 models, with the only difference in the length of the MCMC estimation. The increase yields narrower distributions for the goodness of fit statistics but does not improve on model fit.

fitGIPKVP <- readRDS(file = "models/fitGIPKVP.rds") # AME Drop all non significant

**Limitations and Further Approaches**

Before entering the limitations and the discussion on the AME network model, two possible approaches to improve the present issues:

*1.* These changes in model specifications did only affect dyadic covariates. Given the persistent trend in the variance of the additive effect and the intercept, one could hypothesize that the actor-specific propensity of tie formation is not sufficiently considered within the models' fixed effects. This could be alleviated by adding more nodal covariates. Unfortunately, there was no evident political or economic factor that could have been included. One option could be to construct an index of vote patterns in the United Nations, along the lines of the outcome variable in @dynamicAMEN. This is left for further exploration. 


*2.* Wide posterior intervals indicate a wide distribution about the parameter estimates of the intercept and the variance of the additive effects. This could present problems with the posterior estimation.^[See for example @mcmcissues.] A natural step would be to specify different starting values as well as stronger priors, specifically for the intercept. The network density^[This calculation takes into account every state in the data, it therefore slightly understimates the density provided before.] ranges from `r round(range(gden(allyNet, mode = "digraph"))[1], 3)` to `r round(range(gden(allyNet, mode = "digraph"))[2], 3)` in the time-frame 1981 - 2000. Assuming this low density is a reliable characteristic of the interstate alliance network, a narrower prior distribution, could be selected for the intercept.

The low effective sample size and the troublesome trace plots of the AME network model leave doubts about the validity of statistical inference in this application case. Further analysis to improve the model fitting procedure would need to tackle the MCMC estimation procedure with more elaborated tools on the analysis of different chains as the visual approach provided in this seminar paper. The present issues could have their roots in different aspects of the chosen data set. The absence of strong predictors for the actor-specific propensity of tie formation, for example. A very low network density, along with large heterogeneity in the network actors too; as well as the symmetric, binary outcome.

# Discussion

The Additive and Multiplicative Effects network model provides an extension to the already familiar generalized linear model framework to network data. By adding a node-specific additive random effect and a latent space as a multiplicative effect, an AME model can capture a range of statistical network effects that are inherent in dyadic data and ordinary regression frameworks that fail to account for (Figure \@ref(fig:gofstats)). The deliberate omission of these effects can lead to significantly biased estimates of effect sizes. In this regard, the AME Model presented in @Hoff2021 provides an easy-to-use and interpretable model for network data. 

However, the Bayesian estimation procedure makes it difficult for non-statisticians and statisticians alike to pin down the issues in the estimation, for example in this paper, and thus to establish valid statistical inference. It requires furthermore a different approach to model assessment and goodness of fit, specifically with covariate selection in mind. 

@violenceNetworks apply the AME network model to study civil conflict in Nigeria and the implications of the emergence of Boko Haram. This model has also been expanded to include longitudinal networks or replicated data. @Minhas_Hoff_Ward_2016 use a time series approach of the AME network model presented in @hoff2015longitudinal to study international relations, in this case, the type of interaction chosen by each state. @dynamicAMEN model UN Voting Behaviour in a similar fashion with a longitudinal extension of the AME framework which relies on Gaussian processes.
