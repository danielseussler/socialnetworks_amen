# Introduction

## Network Effects

- Dyadic Data
- Get out of bed


# Theory

## The Additive Part

$$ y_{ij} = \mu + e_{ij}$$
$$ e_{ij} = a_i + b_j + e_{ij}$$


## The Multiplicative Part

## Goodness of Fit

- Dyadic and Triadic Dependency
- Trace Plots

## Extensions

- Binary Data
- Censored Data
- Ordinal Data

## Extension: Longitudinal Networks

- Vector Auto Regression Models
- Time as Interaction 


# Application: The Alliances Data Set

## Network Statistics

- Statistic 1
- Statistic 2

## Visualization

- Figure 1

## Towards AME Models

- SRM Results
- Latent Factor Results

## Final 

- Comparison with model xx
- Goodness of Fit

## Longitudinal Data 19xx-20xx

- Early Results 
- Identification Issues 


## The End

- Thank you very much for your attention!
