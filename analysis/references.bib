    abstract = { Previous models of international conflict have suffered two shortfalls. They tend not to embody dynamic changes, focusing rather on static slices of behavior over time across a single relational dimension. These models have also been empirically evaluated in ways that assumed the independence of each country, when in reality they are searching for the interdependence among all countries. A number of approaches are available now for analyzing relational data such as international conflict in a network context and a number of these can even handle longitudinal relational data, but none are developed to the point of exploring how networks can coevolve over time. We illustrate a solution to the limitations of existing approaches and apply this novel, dynamic, network based approach to study the dependencies among the ebb and flow of daily international interactions using a newly developed, and openly available, database of events among nations. }

abstract = {Network datasets typically exhibit certain types of statistical patterns, such as within-dyad correlation, degree heterogeneity, and triadic patterns such as transitivity and clustering. The first two of these can be well represented with a social relations model, a type of additive effects model originally developed for continuous dyadic data. Higher-order patterns can be represented with multiplicative effects models, which are related to matrix decompositions that are commonly used for matrix-variate data analysis. Additionally, these multiplicative effects models generalize other popular latent feature network models, such as the stochastic blockmodel and the latent space model. In this article, we review a general regression framework for the analysis of network data that combines these two types of effects, and accommodates a variety of network data types, including continuous, binary and ordinal network relations.},

    abstract = { This article introduces the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) dataset. We begin by describing the rationale for collecting the ATOP data, its scope, and some general coding rules for the project. Then we offer some descriptive statistics for phase one of the dataset, which covers the years 1815-1944, and reveal some interesting trends in alliance politics. Finally, we replicate a study of alliance formation originally conducted by Lai and Reiter (2000) to demonstrate the effect the use of ATOP data may have on past inferences about alliance politics. }
